# Me and Python

**What are the primary uses for Python?**

*Python is mainly used for data analytics, machine learning, or any practical application where something needs to be coded quickly and easily. It's extremely versatile, and can be coded multiple ways, including functionally and also in an object-oriented manner.*

**What are some positives to using Python?**

*As mentioned before, it's extremely versatile and easy to pick up. It's also easy to create quick programs because of the simplicity of the language.*

**What are some downsides to using Python?**

*I believe one downside are its variables. They are very flexible and the way you define them are so open that you are bound to run into errors sometimes. It also probably makes the language inefficient at compilation in some areas. Because it is such a high level language, it's also less efficient and more memory intensive as other languages.*

**What is Pygame and what is it used for?**

*It is a set of modules used for developing video games and multimedia projects within python. Just like modules like "random" or "system", it makes developing games much easier and provides the tools to do things that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.*
