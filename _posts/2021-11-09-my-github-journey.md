# My Github Journey

**Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?**

*I am very excited to continue my learning within web development! At the end of the 14 weeks (if I don't already have a job lined up), I intend to continue my learning and focus more on my job search. I definitely want to expand my knowledge beyond just web development, so I'll learn different languages and stacks so that I can prove myself useful in any field.*

**What about 6 months from now?**

*Hopefully I would have landed a job and started my journey as a real developer.*

**or 1 year from now?**

*My goal is to be an extremely absorbent sponge. I hope I learn a ton on the job and prove myself to be a great asset to the company I work for or the individuals I contract for.*

**Are you excited? Scared? Eager?**

*I'm more excited and eager than anything else. I'll be nervous when I start interviewing. Right now, learning is the fun part.*

**What do you hope to accomplish?**

*I'm switching fields, so I understand what it's like to learn a craft or trade. My goal is to, as mentioned earlier, be a sponge, and seek opportunity. sharpening myself to become a seasoned and skilled developer is my main goal, along with networking and giving myself a chance to thrive.*

**Can you foresee potential roadblocks?**

*Absolutely. I can guarantee roadblocks! This could include learning roadblocks, and also job hunting roadblocks.*

**What can be done to prevent or circumvent them?**

*I don't actually think there's a way to circumvent these obstacles, but you have to have the willpower to pick at those mountains with a pickaxe until you've mined a tunnel.*

**Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success?**

*Please continue to support us and patiently teach us as you already have been. Lastly, continue to reward and encourage curiosity and persistence in our learning.*
