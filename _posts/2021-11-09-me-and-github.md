# Me and Github

**What is the difference between Git and Github?**

*Git is a version control tool that stores local repositories on your computer, or on a local server if you have access to one. Github is an online platform in which you can post Git repositories so that they can be accessed on the world wide web.*

**Why use Git?**

*With Git, you can individually, or with a team, navigate through different versions of your projects, roll back changes to your project, and add on to your project without fear of making critical mistakes and not having a fallback.*

**Why use Github?**

*Github is a great way to share code/projects with a mass audience, or work cooperatively with people that may be not be local to you. Having the functionality of Git repositories as part of a Github post makes modifying or implementing projects convenient.*

**What is the payoff to using Git and Github?**

*As mentioned previously, using Git's version control functionality is essential to development. You want peace of mind and convenience when you're coding, which is already a difficult endeavor. Github is a great platform to not only share code, but to provide a public portfolio for employers and other developers alike.*
